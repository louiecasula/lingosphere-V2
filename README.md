# Lingosphere V2

Inspired by its predecessor, [written in vanilla Python](https://github.com/louiecasula/lingosphere), Lingosphere V2 is a multilingual word-of-the-day web application.
My MVP allows a user to sign up, select their proficiency levels in English and/or Spanish, and receive a word for each day signed in. I hope to add more dimensions to my original Python program by supporting multiple languages (eventually even sign languages!), pronunciations (for different accents), definitions, parts of speech, etymologies, example sentences and more! This is my passion project and I look forward to building on to this as I grow as a developer!
